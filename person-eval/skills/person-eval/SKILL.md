# Person Evaluation Skill

Generate a professional evaluation based on Discourse forum activity, inspired
by Graham Duncan's "What's going on here, with this human?" framework.

**Target**: Evaluate user `$0` on `$1`
**Timeframe**: `$2` (if not specified, use recent activity)

## Instructions

Follow these phases IN ORDER:

### Phase 1: Data Gathering

Use the discourse-mcp tools to collect data:

1. Call `discourse_select_site` with site URL: `$1`
2. Call `discourse_get_user` to get the profile for: `$0`
3. Call `discourse_list_user_posts` to get their posts, filtering to the specified timeframe if provided (e.g., "2025", "last 6 months", "Q4 2025"). Gather enough pages to cover the period.
4. Call `discourse_read_post` on 8-12 substantive posts from within the timeframe (longer content, interesting topics)

Summarize what you gathered before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Analysis

Analyze the gathered data through these lenses:

- **Communication Style**: Clarity, tone, how they explain things
- **Technical/Domain Depth**: Areas of expertise, quality of explanations
- **Collaboration Patterns**: How they interact, help others, respond to feedback
- **Initiative & Drive**: Starting discussions vs responding, proposing solutions
- **Handling Disagreement**: Response to pushback, updating views
- **Self-Awareness Signals**: Acknowledging gaps, asking questions, qualifying statements

Note specific examples from posts for each dimension.

### Phase 3: Format Output

CRITICAL: Use the EXACT template below. Copy headers VERBATIM. Do not reorganize,
rename sections, or add new sections. Fill in the bracketed placeholders with
your analysis.

## Template Compliance Tips

If you're having trouble with Claude not following templates:

1. **Embed the template directly** - Don't reference external files by path
2. **Put the template at the END** - Recency bias helps compliance
3. **Use explicit language** - Words like "EXACT", "VERBATIM", "copy headers exactly"
4. **Separate phases** - Data gathering, analysis, and formatting as distinct steps
5. **Show the structure** - Literal headers are easier to copy than descriptions
